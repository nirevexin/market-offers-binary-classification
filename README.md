## 📦 Project Summary  
This project addresses a real-world problem from [Samokat.Tech](https://samokat.tech) — a tech-driven, real-time delivery platform. 

I developed the **final stage of a product matching pipeline**, where the task was to determine whether a seller’s offer matches a catalog product.

It’s a **binary classification problem**, using structured tabular features as well as **image and text embeddings**.

## 🧾 About Samokat.Tech  
[Samokat.Tech](https://samokat.tech) powers one of Russia’s most innovative grocery delivery services. Their fully automated and digitized supply chain helped them grow from:

- 📦 **1.6M orders/month in 2020**  
- 🚀 **92M orders in H1 2023**  

This rapid growth is driven by advanced **IT systems**, **machine learning**, and **robotics**.

## 🧠 Problem Formulation  

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a pair of products — one from a marketplace seller, one from the internal catalog — represent the **same item**.

- 🔍 **Match** (`1`)  
- ❌ **No Match** (`0`)  

Each product pair included:
- Tabular attributes
- Image embeddings
- Text embeddings

**Evaluation Metric:**  
F1-Score

### 🔑 Key Columns  
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `offer_depersonalised`, `goods_depersonalised` | IDs of the seller offer and product |
| `attrs+title_score` | Pre-scored match likelihood |
| `sum_length` | Combined length of names & attributes |
| `offer_price`, `item_price` | Prices for each item |
| `target` | Binary match label (in train.csv only) |

### 🔎 Embeddings  
- Image vectors: `goods_image_vectors`, `offer_image_vectors`

## 🚀 Workflow Highlights

- 🧹 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 🔍 Feature engineering on embeddings and tabular data
- 📉 PCA applied to embeddings for efficiency
- 🧠 LightGBM model trained
- 🛠️ Optimized LightGBM model by tuning iterations (early stopping at ~300)
- 📈 Achieved higher F1-Score with lower computational cost

## 🏆 Final Results  

 Model          F1 Score  Notes 
--------------------------------
 LightGBM (optimized, 300 iters)  0.9206  ✅ Best performance, efficient 
 LightGBM (non-optimized, 1500 iters)  0.9193  ❌ Overfitting, slower 

✅ Final choice LightGBM (300 iterations) — faster training and better generalization.

- 📈 **Recommendation:**  
  For production-level deployment, I suggest using **Optuna** to fine-tune hyperparameters automatically and achieve the best balance between speed and accuracy.
